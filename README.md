# MapReduce

Repository for MapReduce source from my first explorations into the subject.

I had essentially no experience with Java and had never used Eclipse or Maven before.  WordCount, AlphaCount
and FriendsYouMayKnow are based on material from the Stanford class, [CS246](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/index.html).

I also have a SlideShare [deck](http://www.slideshare.net/JosephDuimstraPhD/mapreduce-51395346) discussing my first impressions on MapReduce after having finsihed edX CS190.1x, Scalable Machine Learning using PySpark.
